# Blogging App

## Problem Statement
Make a web application for blogging which has built-in capabilities to handle various users.

## Requirements
- CRUD capabilities for USERS: Implement create, read, update, and delete functionalities for users.
- CRUD capabilities for BLOGS: Blogs should be scoped under a user, meaning only the user who creates a blog can modify or delete it.
- View BLOGS: All users should be able to view blogs that have been posted.
- Write and Post BLOGS: Users should be able to write and post blogs for everyone to see.
- Follow Users: Users should be able to follow other users so that their blogs have a higher priority on their feed.
- Comments: Users should be able to comment on blogs, and these comments would be public.
- Like/Unlike: Users should be able to like or unlike a blog.

## Basic Flow
Subject to changes based on your desired UX:
1. Sign up or sign in to create a user profile on the application.
2. Main feed: Users can see cards for various blogs. Blogs from users they follow would have higher priority.
3. Blog page: Opens when clicking a blog card and displays the complete contents of the blog.
4. Comments section: Users can add comments and read other comments about the blog.
5. Blog editor: Users can create and post blogs.
6. Blog editor: Users can edit already posted blogs.
7. User profiles: Users can view other user profiles and follow/unfollow them.

## Submission Expectations
Points to focus on during evaluation:
- Working and demonstrable code.
- Readable code using best practices.
- Optimized code without hardcoding logic.
- Proper README for easy navigation and installation.
- User-friendly UI with good UX.

## Optional Requirements (Good to Haves)
Try to work on these features once all the required features are complete:
- Drafts: Capability to add blogs to drafts before posting them.
- Scheduled Posting: Capability to schedule when a blog gets posted.
- Notifications: Sending notifications to users who follow a user when they post a new blog or make changes to an existing one.
- Sorting Feed: Capability to sort the feed by time of posting, topics, etc.
- Responsive UI: Make the UI responsive.
- Blog Buckets: Ability to group various blogs together under a bucket (topic) and create a sequence of blogs.

Feel free to modify and expand this README template according to your specific project requirements. Good luck with your Blogging App!
